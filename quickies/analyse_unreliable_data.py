analyse_unreliable_data.py

This file was used to check how many species have unreliable records that we can use to train our models, and how much balancing work would need to be done
It isn't used, or necessary for the final project, but was helpful in us understanding the data given

Call with `python3 analyse_unreliable_data.py {filename}`
